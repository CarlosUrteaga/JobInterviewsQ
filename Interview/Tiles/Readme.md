#Exercice

You are in a field of tiles, *m*. Each tile may or may not have a sign on it.There are 4 possible types of signs:
* "S" is your starting point;* "F" is the finish;* "R" means that you have to turn 90 degrees clockwise;* "L" means that you have to turn 90 degrees counterclockwise.Empty tiles are represented with the character "-".Your starting direction is d.The steps of the game are:1.	Start from the tile with the sign "S", pointing to the direction d;2.	Move forward until you reach a sign or the edge of the field;3.	If you reach a sign, do what it says depending on the sign;4.	If you reach the edge of the field, the game ends.Your task is to return *true* if you have reached the finish sign at the end of the game, or *false* if you have not.##Example	For	m = ["S-R",      "F-R"]and **d** = "R", the output should be**gameOfSigns(m, d) = true.**##Here's how it works:![Ejemplo](https://github.com/CarlosUrteaga/JobInterviewsQ/blob/master/Interview/Tiles/Picture1.png?raw=true)**Input/Output**
* [time limit] 4000ms (py)* [input] array.string mThere will be only 1 "S" sign and 1 "F" sign in a field.It is guaranteed that there won't be an infinite loop trap.Guaranteed constraints:	0 < m.length ≤ 1000,	0 < m[i].length ≤ 1000,	m[i].length = m[j].length.* [input] string dThe direction in which you move at the start of the game. The options for d are the strings "U"(up), "D"(down), "R"(right), or "L"(left).* [output] booleanReturn true if you end up reaching the finish sign at the end of the game, otherwise return false.
